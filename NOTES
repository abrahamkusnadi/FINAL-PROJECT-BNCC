This is my first Project using Laravel, It's very fun yet stressful. I have a lot more to learn, but I already understand the basic using Laravel Framework. 
There is a little bit lack in this project, I can't show the picture that the user input for the product. And I don't know how to solve it. Maybe one of you guys know,
just hit me up on LinkedIn @Abraham Kusnadi or in My GitHub Bio.
